# Use mingit with Oh My Zsh

Add mingit as a custom plugin to your ohmyzsh installation:

1. Copy the below `mingit` subdirectory to `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/`
2. Add `mingit` to the list of plugins in your `~/.zshrc` file:
    1. `plugins=(... mingit)`

_Note: `mingit` overrides some functionality of the `git` ohmyzsh plugin.  For best results, use one or the other._
